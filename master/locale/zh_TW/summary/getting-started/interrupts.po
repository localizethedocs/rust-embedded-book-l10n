"Interrupts differ from exceptions in a variety of ways but their operation "
"and use is largely similar and they are also handled by the same interrupt "
"controller. Whereas exceptions are defined by the Cortex-M architecture, "
"interrupts are always vendor (and often even chip) specific implementations, "
"both in naming and functionality."

"Interrupts do allow for a lot of flexibility which needs to be accounted for "
"when attempting to use them in an advanced way. We will not cover those uses "

"Instead, you should use the re-exported version of the interrupt attribute "

"the target device. The list of available interrupts—and their position in "
