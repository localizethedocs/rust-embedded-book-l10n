msgid ""
"Panicking is a core part of the Rust language. Built-in operations like "
"indexing are runtime checked for memory safety. When out of bounds indexing "
"is attempted this results in a panic."
msgstr ""

#: src/start/panicking.md:7
msgid ""
"In the standard library panicking has a defined behavior: it unwinds the "
"stack of the panicking thread, unless the user opted for aborting the "
"program on panics."
msgstr ""

#: src/start/panicking.md:11
msgid ""
"In programs without standard library, however, the panicking behavior is "
"left undefined. A behavior can be chosen by declaring a `#[panic_handler]` "
"function. This function must appear exactly _once_ in the dependency graph "
"of a program, and must have the following signature: `fn(&PanicInfo) -> !`, "
"where [`PanicInfo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/panic/struct.PanicInfo."
"html) is a struct containing information about the location of the panic."
msgstr ""

#: src/start/panicking.md:19
msgid ""
"Given that embedded systems range from user facing to safety critical "
"(cannot crash) there's no one size fits all panicking behavior but there are "
"plenty of commonly used behaviors. These common behaviors have been packaged "
"into crates that define the `#[panic_handler]` function. Some examples "
"include:"
msgstr ""

#: src/start/panicking.md:24
msgid ""
"[`panic-abort`](https://crates.io/crates/panic-abort). A panic causes the "
"abort instruction to be executed."
msgstr ""

#: src/start/panicking.md:25
msgid ""
"[`panic-halt`](https://crates.io/crates/panic-halt). A panic causes the "
"program, or the current thread, to halt by entering an infinite loop."
msgstr ""

#: src/start/panicking.md:27
msgid ""
"[`panic-itm`](https://crates.io/crates/panic-itm). The panicking message is "
"logged using the ITM, an ARM Cortex-M specific peripheral."
msgstr ""

#: src/start/panicking.md:29
msgid ""
"[`panic-semihosting`](https://crates.io/crates/panic-semihosting). The "
"panicking message is logged to the host using the semihosting technique."

"A program can pick one of these behaviors simply by linking to the "
"corresponding crate. The fact that the panicking behavior is expressed in "
"the source of an application as a single line of code is not only useful as "
"documentation but can also be used to change the panicking behavior "
"according to the compilation profile. For example:"
msgstr ""

#: src/start/panicking.md:51
msgid ""
"// dev profile: easier to debug panics; can put a breakpoint on "
"`rust_begin_unwind`\n"

msgid "// ..\n"

#: src/start/panicking.md:63
msgid ""
"In this example the crate links to the `panic-halt` crate when built with "
"the dev profile (`cargo build`), but links to the `panic-abort` crate when "
"built with the release profile (`cargo build --release`)."
msgstr ""

#: src/start/panicking.md:67
msgid ""
"The `use panic_abort as _;` form of the `use` statement is used to ensure "
"the `panic_abort` panic handler is included in our final executable while "
"making it clear to the compiler that we won't explicitly use anything from "
"the crate. Without the `as _` rename, the compiler would warn that we have "
"an unused import. Sometimes you might see `extern crate panic_abort` "
"instead, which is an older style used before the 2018 edition of Rust, and "
"should now only be used for \"sysroot\" crates (those distributed with Rust "
"itself) such as `proc_macro`, `alloc`, `std`, and `test`."
