"Exceptions, and interrupts, are a hardware mechanism by which the processor "
"handles asynchronous events and fatal errors (e.g. executing an invalid "
"instruction). Exceptions imply preemption and involve exception handlers, "
"subroutines executed in response to the signal that triggered the event."

"Other than the `exception` attribute exception handlers look like plain "

"As you may know, using `static mut` variables in a function makes it [_non-"
"reentrant_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrancy_(computing)). It's "
"undefined behavior to call a non-reentrant function, directly or indirectly, "
"from more than one exception / interrupt handler or from `main` and one or "
"more exception / interrupt handlers."

#: src/start/exceptions.md:44

"Safe Rust must never result in undefined behavior so non-reentrant functions "
"must be marked as `unsafe`. Yet I just told that `exception` handlers can "
"safely use `static mut` variables. How is this possible? This is possible "
"because `exception` handlers can _not_ be called by software thus reentrancy "
"is not possible. These handlers are called by the hardware itself which is "
"assumed to be physically non-concurrent."
msgstr ""

#: src/start/exceptions.md:50
msgid ""
"As a result, in the context of exception handlers in embedded systems, the "
"absence of concurrent invocations of the same handler ensures that there are "
"no reentrancy issues, even if the handler uses static mutable variables."
msgstr ""

#: src/start/exceptions.md:52
msgid ""
"In a multicore system, where multiple processor cores are executing code "
"concurrently, the potential for reentrancy issues becomes relevant again, "
"even within exception handlers. While each core may have its own set of "
"exception handlers, there can still be scenarios where multiple cores "
"attempt to execute the same exception handler simultaneously.  \n"
"To address this concern in a multicore environment, proper synchronization "
"mechanisms need to be employed within the exception handlers to ensure that "
"access to shared resources is properly coordinated among the cores. This "
"typically involves the use of techniques such as locks, semaphores, or "
"atomic operations to prevent data races and maintain data integrity"

#: src/start/exceptions.md:55
msgid ""
"Note that the `exception` attribute transforms definitions of static "
"variables inside the function by wrapping them into `unsafe` blocks and "
"providing us with new appropriate variables of type `&mut` of the same name. "
"Thus we can dereference the reference via `*` to access the values of the "
"variables without needing to wrap them in an `unsafe` block."
