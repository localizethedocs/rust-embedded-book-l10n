"Semihosting is a mechanism that lets embedded devices do I/O on the host and "
"is mainly used to log messages to the host console. Semihosting requires a "
"debug session and pretty much nothing else (no extra wires!) so it's super "
"convenient to use. The downside is that it's super slow: each write "
"operation can take several milliseconds depending on the hardware debugger "
"(e.g. ST-Link) you use."
