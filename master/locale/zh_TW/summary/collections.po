"Eventually you'll want to use dynamic data structures (AKA collections) in "

#: src/collections/index.md:162
msgid ""
"First, you have to declare upfront the capacity of the collection. "
"`heapless` collections never reallocate and have fixed capacities; this "
"capacity is part of the type signature of the collection. In this case we "
"have declared that `xs` has a capacity of 8 elements that is the vector can, "
"at most, hold 8 elements. This is indicated by the `U8` (see [`typenum`]"
"(https://crates.io/crates/typenum)) in the type signature."
msgstr ""

#: src/collections/index.md:170
msgid ""
"Second, the `push` method, and many other methods, return a `Result`. Since "
"the `heapless` collections have fixed capacity all operations that insert "
"elements into the collection can potentially fail. The API reflects this "
"problem by returning a `Result` indicating whether the operation succeeded "
"or not. In contrast, `alloc` collections will reallocate themselves on the "
"heap to increase their capacity."
msgstr ""

#: src/collections/index.md:177
msgid ""
"As of version v0.4.x all `heapless` collections store all their elements "
"inline. This means that an operation like `let x = heapless::Vec::new();` "
"will allocate the collection on the stack, but it's also possible to "
"allocate the collection on a `static` variable, or even on the heap "
"(`Box<Vec<_, _>>`)."

msgid ""
"With heap allocations Out Of Memory is always a possibility and can occur in "
"any place where a collection may need to grow: for example, all `alloc::Vec."
"push` invocations can potentially generate an OOM condition. Thus some "
"operations can _implicitly_ fail. Some `alloc` collections expose "
"`try_reserve` methods that let you check for potential OOM conditions when "
"growing the collection but you need be proactive about using them."
msgstr ""

#: src/collections/index.md:196
msgid ""
"If you exclusively use `heapless` collections and you don't use a memory "
"allocator for anything else then an OOM condition is impossible. Instead, "

"case basis. That is you'll have deal with _all_ the `Result`s returned by "

msgstr ""

#: src/collections/index.md:202

"OOM failures can be harder to debug than say `unwrap`\\-ing on all `Result`s "
"returned by `heapless::Vec.push` because the observed location of failure "
"may _not_ match with the location of the cause of the problem. For example, "
"even `vec.reserve(1)` can trigger an OOM if the allocator is nearly "

msgid "Memory usage"
msgstr ""

#: src/collections/index.md:211
msgid ""
"Reasoning about memory usage of heap allocated collections is hard because "
"the capacity of long lived collections can change at runtime. Some "
"operations may implicitly reallocate the collection increasing its memory "
"usage, and some collections expose methods like `shrink_to_fit` that can "
"potentially reduce the memory used by the collection -- ultimately, it's up "
"to the allocator to decide whether to actually shrink the memory allocation "
"or not. Additionally, the allocator may have to deal with memory "
"fragmentation which can increase the _apparent_ memory usage."
msgstr ""

#: src/collections/index.md:220

"On the other hand if you exclusively use fixed capacity collections, store "

#: src/collections/index.md:232
