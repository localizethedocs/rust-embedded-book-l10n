"The GpioConfig we return never exists at runtime. Calling this function will "
"generally boil down to a single assembly instruction - storing a constant "
"register value to a register location. This means that the type state "
"interface we've developed is a zero cost abstraction - it uses no more CPU, "
"RAM, or code space tracking the state of `GpioConfig`, and renders to the "
"same machine code as a direct register access."
