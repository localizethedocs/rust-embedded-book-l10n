"The closest match to `#ifdef ... #endif` in Rust are [Cargo features]"
"(https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-features-"
"section). These are a little more formal than the C preprocessor: all "
"possible features are explicitly listed per crate, and can only be either on "
"or off. Features are turned on when you list a crate as a dependency, and "
"are additive: if any crate in your dependency tree enables a feature for "
"another crate, that feature will be enabled for all users of that crate."
msgstr ""

#: src/c-tips/index.md:31
msgid ""
"For example, you might have a crate which provides a library of signal "
"processing primitives. Each one might take some extra time to compile or "
"declare some large table of constants which you'd like to avoid. You could "
"declare a Cargo feature for each component in your `Cargo.toml`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The conditional compilation will only apply to the next statement or block. "
"If a block can not be used in the current scope then the `cfg` attribute "
"will need to be used multiple times.  It's worth noting that most of the "
"time it is better to simply include all the code and allow the compiler to "
"remove dead code when optimising: it's simpler for you and your users, and "
"in general the compiler will do a good job of removing unused code."

"Rust supports `const fn`, functions which are guaranteed to be evaluable at "

"These are new to stable Rust as of 1.31, so documentation is still sparse. "

msgid "Macros"
msgstr ""

#: src/c-tips/index.md:96
msgid ""
"Rust provides an extremely powerful [macro system](https://doc.rust-lang.org/"
"book/ch19-06-macros.html). While the C preprocessor operates almost directly "
"on the text of your source code, the Rust macro system operates at a higher "
"level. There are two varieties of Rust macro: _macros by example_ and "
"_procedural macros_. The former are simpler and most common; they look like "
"function calls and can expand to a complete expression, statement, item, or "
"pattern. Procedural macros are more complex but permit extremely powerful "
"additions to the Rust language: they can transform arbitrary Rust syntax "
"into new Rust syntax."
msgstr ""

#: src/c-tips/index.md:107
msgid ""
"In general, where you might have used a C preprocessor macro, you probably "
"want to see if a macro-by-example can do the job instead. They can be "
"defined in your crate and easily used by your own crate or exported for "
"other users. Be aware that since they must expand to complete expressions, "
"statements, items, or patterns, some use cases of C preprocessor macros will "
"not work, for example a macro that expands to part of a variable name or an "
"incomplete set of items in a list."
msgstr ""

#: src/c-tips/index.md:115
msgid ""
"As with Cargo features, it is worth considering if you even need the macro. "
"In many cases a regular function is easier to understand and will be inlined "
"to the same code as a macro. The `#[inline]` and `#[inline(always)]` "
"[attributes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes.html#inline-"
"attribute) give you further control over this process, although care should "
"be taken here as well — the compiler will automatically inline functions "
"from the same crate where appropriate, so forcing it to do so "
"inappropriately might actually lead to decreased performance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most Rust crates are built using Cargo (although it is not required). This "
"takes care of many difficult problems with traditional build systems. "
"However, you may wish to customise the build process. Cargo provides [`build."
"rs` scripts](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html) "

msgid "In C you are probably used to accessing arrays directly by their index:"
msgstr ""

#: src/c-tips/index.md:175
msgid ""
"In Rust this is an anti-pattern: indexed access can be slower (as it needs "
"to be bounds checked) and may prevent various compiler optimisations. This "
"is an important distinction and worth repeating: Rust will check for out-of-"
"bounds access on manual array indexing to guarantee memory safety, while C "
"will happily index outside the array."
msgstr ""

msgid "Instead, use iterators:"

"In Rust, pointers (called [_raw pointers_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/"
"ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#dereferencing-a-raw-pointer)) exist but are only "

"`unsafe` -- Rust cannot provide its usual guarantees about what might be "
"behind the pointer."
msgstr ""

#: src/c-tips/index.md:208
msgid ""
"In most cases, we instead use _references_, indicated by the `&` symbol, or "
"_mutable references_, indicated by `&mut`. References behave similarly to "
"pointers, in that they can be dereferenced to access the underlying values, "
"but they are a key part of Rust's ownership system: Rust will strictly "
"enforce that you may only have one mutable reference _or_ multiple non-"
"mutable references to the same value at any given time."
msgstr ""

#: src/c-tips/index.md:215
msgid ""
"In practice this means you have to be more careful about whether you need "
"mutable access to data: where in C the default is mutable and you must be "
"explicit about `const`, in Rust the opposite is true."
msgstr ""

#: src/c-tips/index.md:219
msgid ""
"One situation where you might still use raw pointers is interacting directly "
"with hardware (for example, writing a pointer to a buffer into a DMA "
"peripheral register), and they are also used under the hood for all "
"peripheral access crates to allow you to read and write memory-mapped "
"registers."

"In C, individual variables may be marked `volatile`, indicating to the "

"Volatile variables are commonly used in an embedded context for memory-"
"mapped registers."
msgstr ""

#: src/c-tips/index.md:230
msgid ""
"In Rust, instead of marking a variable as `volatile`, we use specific "
"methods to perform volatile access: [`core::ptr::read_volatile`](https://doc."
"rust-lang.org/core/ptr/fn.read_volatile.html) and [`core::ptr::"
"write_volatile`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/fn.write_volatile.html). "
