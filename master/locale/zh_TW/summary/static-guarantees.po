"Rust's type system prevents data races at compile time (see [`Send`](https://"
"doc.rust-lang.org/core/marker/trait.Send.html) and [`Sync`](https://doc.rust-"
"lang.org/core/marker/trait.Sync.html) traits). The type system can also be "
"used to check other properties at compile time; reducing the need for "
"runtime checks in some cases."

"When applied to embedded programs these _static checks_ can be used, for "
"example, to enforce that configuration of I/O interfaces is done properly. "
"For instance, one can design an API where it is only possible to initialize "
"a serial interface by first configuring the pins that will be used by the "
"interface."

"One can also statically check that operations, like setting a pin low, can "
"only be performed on correctly configured peripherals. For example, trying "
"to change the output state of a pin configured in floating input mode would "
"raise a compile error."

"And, as seen in the previous chapter, the concept of ownership can be "
"applied to peripherals to ensure that only certain parts of a program can "
"modify a peripheral. This _access control_ makes software easier to reason "
"about compared to the alternative of treating peripherals as global mutable "
"state."
