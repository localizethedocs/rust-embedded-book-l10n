"This is the default. When you call `cargo build` you use the development "

"At least for bare metal development, debuginfo is zero cost in the sense "
"that it won't occupy space in Flash / ROM so we actually recommend that you "
"enable debuginfo in the release profile -- it is disabled by default. That "

"No optimizations is great for debugging because stepping through the code "

"The biggest downside of the `dev` profile is that the resulting binary will "
