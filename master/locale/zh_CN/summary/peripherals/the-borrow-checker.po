#: src/peripherals/borrowck.md:3
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, hardware is basically nothing but mutable global state, which "
"can feel very frightening for a Rust developer. Hardware exists "
"independently from the structures of the code we write, and can be modified "
"at any time by the real world."

"Always use `volatile` methods to read or write to peripheral memory, as it "

"If some software should have read-write access to a peripheral, it should "

"Imagine if we could pass around ownership of these peripherals, or offer "
"immutable or mutable references to them?"
msgstr ""

#: src/peripherals/borrowck.md:19
msgid ""
"Well, we can, but for the Borrow Checker, we need to have exactly one "
"instance of each peripheral, so Rust can handle this correctly. Well, "
"luckily in the hardware, there is only one instance of any given peripheral, "
"but how can we expose that in the structure of our code?"
