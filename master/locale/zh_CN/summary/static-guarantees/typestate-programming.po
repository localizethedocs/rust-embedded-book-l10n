"The concept of [typestates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Typestate_analysis) describes the encoding of information about the current "
"state of an object into the type of that object. Although this can sound a "
"little arcane, if you have used the [Builder Pattern](https://doc.rust-lang."
"org/1.0.0/style/ownership/builders.html) in Rust, you have already started "
"using Typestate Programming!"

"Because Rust has a [Strong Type System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Strong_and_weak_typing), there is no easy way to magically create an "
"instance of `Foo`, or to turn a `FooBuilder` into a `Foo` without calling "
"the `into_foo()` method. Additionally, calling the `into_foo()` method "
"consumes the original `FooBuilder` structure, meaning it can not be reused "
"without the creation of a new instance."
