"Most Microcontrollers have more than just a CPU, RAM, or Flash Memory - they "
"contain sections of silicon which are used for interacting with systems "
"outside of the microcontroller, as well as directly and indirectly "
"interacting with their surroundings in the world via sensors, motor "
"controllers, or human interfaces such as a display or keyboard. These "
"components are collectively known as Peripherals."

"These peripherals are useful because they allow a developer to offload "
"processing to them, avoiding having to handle everything in software. "
"Similar to how a desktop developer would offload graphics processing to a "
"video card, embedded developers can offload some tasks to peripherals "
"allowing the CPU to spend its time doing something else important, or doing "
"nothing in order to save power."

"The RAM chip, ROM chip and I/O controller (the peripheral in this system) "
"would be joined to the processor through a series of parallel traces known "
"as a 'bus'. This bus carries address information, which selects which device "
"on the bus the processor wishes to communicate with, and a data bus which "
"carries the actual data. In our embedded microcontrollers, the same "
"principles apply - it's just that everything is packed on to a single piece "
"of silicon."

"On a desktop system, access to memory is tightly controlled by the MMU, or "
"Memory Management Unit. This component has two major responsibilities: "
"enforcing access permission to sections of memory (preventing one process "
"from reading or modifying the memory of another process); and re-mapping "
"segments of the physical memory to virtual memory ranges used in software. "
"Microcontrollers do not typically have an MMU, and instead only use real "
"physical addresses in software."

"Although 32 bit microcontrollers have a real and linear address space from "
"`0x0000_0000`, and `0xFFFF_FFFF`, they generally only use a few hundred "
"kilobytes of that range for actual memory. This leaves a significant amount "
"of address space remaining. In earlier chapters, we were talking about RAM "
"being located at address `0x2000_0000`. If our RAM was 64 KiB long (i.e. "
"with a maximum address of 0xFFFF) then addresses `0x2000_0000` to "
"`0x2000_FFFF` would correspond to our RAM. When we write to a variable which "
"lives at address `0x2000_1234`, what happens internally is that some logic "
"detects the upper portion of the address (0x2000 in this example) and then "
"activates the RAM so that it can act upon the lower portion of the address "
"(0x1234 in this case). On a Cortex-M we also have our Flash ROM mapped in at "
"address `0x0000_0000` up to, say, address `0x0007_FFFF` (if we have a 512 "
"KiB Flash ROM). Rather than ignore all remaining space between these two "
"regions, Microcontroller designers instead mapped the interface for "
"peripherals in certain memory locations. This ends up looking something like "
"this:"

"Interaction with these peripherals is simple at a first glance - write the "
"right data to the correct address. For example, sending a 32 bit word over a "

"Configuration of these peripherals works similarly. Instead of calling a "
